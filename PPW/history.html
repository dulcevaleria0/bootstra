          <h2>1899 -1909. Foundation and survival</h2>
          <p>Founder of the Club Joan Gamper was the driving force behind FC Barcelona in its first 25 years of
            existence
            FC Barcelona, founded in 1899 by a group of young foreigners living in Barcelona, was the result of the
            increasing popularity of football, and other British sports, across Europe. These origins have conferred
            upon
            the Club its intercultural identity, multi-sport focus and its deeply-rooted allegiance to Barcelona and
            Catalonia. The foundation of the Club coincided with a time when people were becoming interested in playing
            sport in Catalonia; this social context and Catalonia’s idiosyncratic culture led to the creation of a new
            model
            of modern leisure. Gamper, the Club’s founder, was the inspiration and driving force behind the Club’s first
            25
            years. His commitment to FC Barcelona went far beyond his role as player, director and president.</p>

          <h2>1919-30. A golden age</h2>
          <p>The team begins to collect silverware and the players begin to earn a name for themselves
            During the 1920s, football became a sport of the masses. FC Barcelona continued to attract huge amounts of
            support and was viewed as a dream team, comprising star players that became the first Barça idols, such as
            Samitier, Alcántara, Zamora, Sagi, Piera and Sancho.

            This legendary team saw a growth of its fan base, which “prompted” the construction of the football ground
            at
            Les Corts, in 1922; this was the first great Barça stadium. By 1923, the Club had in excess of 10,000
            members.

            Matches played against Barcelona’s other team, Espanyol, Barça’s biggest rival at that time, were always met
            with great expectation from devoted football fans, who followed the team to all its matches. The team
            enjoyed
            many years of success at the Les Corts football ground.</p>

          <h2>1939-50. Years of perseverance</h2>
          <p>Harsh repression and reprisals carried out by the civilian and military authorities in the post-Civil War
            years helped undermine the Club's very essence
            The toughest moments experienced by FC Barcelona football club were the initial post-war years. The Club
            reached a point where it almost ceased to exist. Subject to relentless repression and reprisals by the
            authorities, the identity of the organisation was changed completely.

            The purges also affected the players; anyone who had gone on the tour to Mexico and the United States was
            suspended for two years. Many of the players were exiled abroad. The Club’s coat of arms and name were
            changed because they were not deemed to be sufficiently Spanish, and the Club’s presidents were scrupulously
            selected by the sports authorities until 1946.

            The team formation in subsequent years, however, led to more promising title victories in the 1950s. For
            many people, Barça’s matches at Les Corts represented an oasis of freedom during years of fear, misery and
            repression.</p>

          <h2>1969-78. Cruyff and democracy</h2>
          <p>The possibility of signing foreign players once more meant that the dream of signing Johan Cruyff became a
            reality in 1974 with Montal as president
            In 1969, Agustí Montal Costa won the elections and became president of the Club. His programme insisted on
            member involvement, and was committed to the idea that all members would see their opinions reflected
            through their votes. In 1973, Montal was re-elected president despite only the members' representatives
            being able to vote.

            During his presidency, Montal avidly defended the restoration of Catalanism and was firmly opposed to
            centralism in football, as exercised by the Spanish Football Federation and the National Sports Delegation.
            His influence led Futbol Club Barcelona to begin to recover its symbols, starting with the organisation’s
            name that had been changed to sound more Spanish after the Civil War.

            The outbreak of corruption associated with foreign players who falsified birth certificates in order to
            claim Spanish heritage and be admitted into Spanish football meant that it became possible to sign foreign
            players. Barça’s dream of signing Johan Cruyff began to look like a reality.</p>

          <h2>1996-2008. Barça reaches its century</h2>
          <p>The centenary celebrations were a demonstration of what Barça means to people, an emotional journey through
            the Club's history that lasted the whole year
            Few organisations reach their one hundredth anniversary, for doing so requires consistence and continuity.
            The aim of FC Barcelona's centenary was to celebrate the link between a glorious past and new hope for the
            future.

            The commemorative events saw an outpouring of Barça sentiment, and offered an emotional opportunity to spend
            a year looking back at the Club's proud history. Several important figures from Catalan culture were
            involved, as did the media and several major organisations. Famous artist Antoni Tàpies designed the
            official Centenary poster, thus adding his name to list of internationally renowned artists and writers that
            have helped aggrandise FC Barcelona's symbolic universe over the years.

            The 1998-99 season, that of the Centenary celebrations, was also historic because of the many sporting
            achievements: all four of the Club's professional sections (Football, Basketball, Handball and Roller
            Hockey) won their respective league titles.

            In 2003, newly elected president Joan Laporta brought with him a young and dynamic generation of directors
            who totally changed the Club's image. His priority was to make it possible for the club's sporting successes
            to have a knock-on effect on the more social aspects of the Club.</p>

          <h2>THE RETURN OF GUARDIOLA </h2>
          <p>In 2008, Josep Guardiola accepted the difficult job of replacing Frank Rijkaard as coach and end a run of
            two seasons without a trophy. To do so, he applied the same style of play that was used when he was a player
            at the Club, an attacking philosophy based on passing and it turned out to be a great success.

            In his debut season, Guardiola won all three trophies available. After a winning start to the following
            campaign in 2009/10, Barça became the team of the Six Trophies, all won in the calendar year of 2009. The
            run of success continued with Guardiola claiming 14 titles of a possible 19 as coach in his four seasons in
            charge. Guardiola became a reference point in football and his Barça side went beyond the strictly
            footballing field.</p>

            titles that they claimed with authority, Barça on the field were untouchable. At the end of the season there
            were celebrations and the trophies kept coming for the rest of the year.</p>
